This project focuses on developing a computer vision system for identifying individual primates, leveraging a combination of synthetic datasets and real-world video footage. The synthetic dataset, generated to simulate diverse environmental conditions and primate poses, is used to augment the limited availability of labeled real-world footage. By integrating these two data sources, the model learns to generalize across varying scenarios, improving its ability to accurately identify primates in naturalistic settings. Key components of the project include dataset creation and augmentation, designing and training deep learning models, and evaluating performance in terms of accuracy and robustness. This work has implications for wildlife research, conservation efforts, and advancing techniques for dataset synthesis in machine learning.
