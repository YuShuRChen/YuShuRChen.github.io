This project focuses on the integration of memory as a crucial component in logical reasoning tasks, particularly in arithmetic. I am investigating several neural architectures that emulate human memory systems, with the current emphasis on developing a spiking neural network (SNN) designed to function as a declarative memory network. This network serves as a long-term memory system capable of storing and recalling single-digit arithmetic operations. The overarching goal of this work is to integrate the declarative memory network with a procedural memory network, forming a larger, cohesive system. This integrated system aims to perform arithmetic tasks logically by leveraging declarative knowledge for fact retrieval and procedural reasoning for computation. Through this project, I aim to better understand the role of memory in reasoning and explore how biologically inspired networks, like SNNs, can be applied to enhance artificial intelligence systemsâ€™ capacity for logical reasoning and task generalization.
